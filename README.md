Thanks for your interests in our paper!
Since I am busy working on my master studies, the code has not yet been wrapped up properly to open source. Hopefully I can release it soon after the finals of this semester. But if you are very interested in getting the code instantly, send a mail to bryanw@dgp.toronto.edu then we can talk about this.
